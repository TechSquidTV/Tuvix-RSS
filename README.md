Tuvix is a modern RSS aggregator that helps you follow all your favorite blogs, podcasts, and news sources in one place. It's not a social network, it's not an algorithmic feed, it's just old-fashioned RSS.

## 🚀 Deployment

Tuvix supports two deployment methods:

- **🐳 Docker Compose** - Self-hosted with containers
- **☁️ Cloudflare** - Serverless edge deployment (Workers + Pages)

See the **[Deployment Guide](./docs/deployment.md)** for detailed instructions.

### Quick Start (Docker)

The docker-compose.yml works with both pre-built images and source builds:

**Option 1: Pre-built Images (Recommended - Fast)**

```bash
# Create directory and download files
mkdir Tuvix-RSS && cd Tuvix-RSS
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TechSquidTV/Tuvix-RSS/main/docker-compose.yml
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TechSquidTV/Tuvix-RSS/main/env.example
cp env.example .env

# Edit .env and configure:
# 1. BETTER_AUTH_SECRET (generate: openssl rand -base64 32)
# 2. Admin credentials (ADMIN_USERNAME, ADMIN_EMAIL, ADMIN_PASSWORD)
nano .env

# Pin to specific version (optional)
export VERSION=v0.6.1  # Or use 'latest' for newest

# Pull images and start
docker compose pull
docker compose up -d

# Access at http://localhost:5173
```

**Option 2: Build from Source**

> **⚠️ Use a Release:** The `main` branch contains active development and is not guaranteed to be stable. Always use the latest release for self-hosting.

Clone the repository and checkout the latest release:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/TechSquidTV/Tuvix-RSS.git
cd Tuvix-RSS
# Checkout the latest release tag (v*)
git checkout $(git tag -l 'v*' | sort -V | tail -n1)
```

Configure and run:

```bash
cp env.example .env
# Edit .env and configure:
# 1. BETTER_AUTH_SECRET (generate: openssl rand -base64 32)
# 2. ADMIN_USERNAME, ADMIN_EMAIL, ADMIN_PASSWORD (for your admin user)
nano .env

# Build and start (includes git version in settings)
pnpm run docker:build
docker compose up -d

# Or build without version script
docker compose build
docker compose up -d
```

Visit `http://localhost:5173` and log in with your admin credentials.

### Development Setup

**Prerequisites:** Node.js 20+ (with pnpm), SQLite3

```bash
pnpm install
cp env.example .env
# Edit .env and set BETTER_AUTH_SECRET, ADMIN_* credentials
pnpm run db:migrate
pnpm run dev
```

App: `http://localhost:5173` | API: `http://localhost:3001`

## 👨‍💻 Development

### Git Workflow

Tuvix uses a **trunk-based development** workflow:

- **`main`** - Protected branch, all development happens here
- **Feature branches** - Created from `main`, merged back via PR

**Development Process:**

1. Create feature branches from `main`: `git checkout -b feature/my-feature`
2. Open PRs targeting `main` for review and CI checks
3. After approval, changes merge to `main` and auto-deploy to staging
4. Production deployments happen via manual promotion or release tags

### Configuration

**Required:**

- `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET` - Generate with: `openssl rand -base64 32`
- `ADMIN_USERNAME`, `ADMIN_EMAIL`, `ADMIN_PASSWORD` - Your admin credentials

**Optional:** `DATABASE_PATH`, `PORT`, `CORS_ORIGIN`, `ALLOW_FIRST_USER_ADMIN`

See `env.example` for all options and [Deployment Guide](./docs/deployment.md) for details.
